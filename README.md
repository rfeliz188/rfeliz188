# Rafael Feliz 👨‍💻 | Azure Cloud Architect & Infrastructure Engineer

Bilingual (EN/ES) cloud professional with **10+ years** delivering **secure, highly available, and automated** Microsoft-first platforms — spanning **Azure**, **hybrid infrastructure**, **identity (AD/Entra ID)**, and **enterprise-scale migrations**. I build repeatable systems with **Terraform/ARM + PowerShell**, and I care about **governance, cost, resiliency, and security hardening (CIS-CAT)**. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## 🚀 What I Deliver
- **Azure Landing Zones & Governance**: RBAC, tagging standards, policy guardrails, cost management
- **Cloud & Hybrid Architecture**: Azure + on-prem integration, site-to-site connectivity, workload modernization
- **Automation at Scale**: IaC-driven provisioning and PowerShell automation for operational excellence
- **Security by Design**: Zero Trust approach, Conditional Access, Defender integrations, CIS-CAT hardening
- **Resilience & Recovery**: DR/BCP patterns, restore testing, runbooks, Veeam/Azure recovery designs :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## 🔥 Current Focus
- Building an **Azure Landing Zone reference implementation** (hub/spoke, governance, security baseline)
- Publishing an **AKS + PaaS deployment blueprint** (repeatable, scalable, CI/CD-ready)
- Expanding a **PowerShell CloudOps Toolkit** (patching, compliance reporting, health checks)
- Documenting **architecture decisions (ADRs)** and operational runbooks for production readiness :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
